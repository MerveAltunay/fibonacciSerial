# fibonacciSerial
Developing a rest service that reproduces the fibonacci serial another application that serves a html page to show the results.

Technologies used: Java, Spring Framework, RESTFul services and Thymeleaf template engine.

Template Engine:
- Created a html page that has an input field for a single number and a submit button to trigger the api.
- When the input is filled and the page is submitted, the controller calls the written REST API.
- Created a second html page that shows the result of the api operation.


Written the unit tests.
Added the dockerfile.
